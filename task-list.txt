That code has been integrated and nominally works.
This will serve as the baseline in addition to the
udp/ip baseline.

Establish baseline measurements:
- tdma 
- UDP/ethernet

(FPE)
- A channel for serial networks
  - support for collision detection either locally
    or by slice owner.

(XSJ)
- A network device for serial communication
  - performs time slicing

(XSJ)
- A helper for building sample networks

(FPE)
- Applications for a representative benchmark
  - position and presence
  - video
  - messaging
